# json-in-html
VSCode extension that supports JSON inside script tags and HTML attributes.

Any script tag containing "json" in the type attribute, as well as any attribute that starts with '{ or '[ (hopefully).

And import maps.

Acknowledgements:  This owes a huge amount of debt to [this great extension](https://github.com/panoply/vscode-json-script-tag).
